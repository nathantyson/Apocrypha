This was a collaborative effort in cooperation with:
Elisha Ott (original game idea, coordinator, and creator of the physical arcade game cabinet)

This project was for the College of Charleston Computing in the Arts 395 class, a class where the entirety of the second half was dedicated towards creating a project meant to blend in artistic creation and coding expertise.
